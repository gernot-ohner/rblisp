A (very) basic Lisp interpreter written in Ruby.

Supports:
- arithmetic operations
- defining variables (though all variables are global)
- renaming existing methods
- using predefined functions compatible with Enumerable#reduce

Does not support: 
- user defined functions
- list literals
- if statements
- all kinds of other stuff
